        <p>
          A lot goes into developing OculusDB. You can help in many ways to improve OculusDB and other tools I (<a href="https://computerelite.github.io/">ComputerElite</a>) make. But without the generous soul of <a href="https://github.com/FranciscoRibeiro03">rui2015</a>, who is hosting this Website for me for free, something at this scale would not have been possible.<br /><br />

          You can help in following ways:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Cover the server cost by <a href="https://rui2015.me/support-me.html">donating to rui2015</a></li>
          <li>Help with development by reporting bugs and suggesting features in the official <a href="https://discord.gg/zwRfHQN2UY">OculusDB Discord server</a></li>
        </ul><br />

        <p>
          There is currently no way to support ComputerElite directly but that may come in future
